## `[159]` Denominator-First Bayesian Meta-Analysis Engine for Registry-Aware Evidence Synthesis

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: False reassurance rate reduction  
**Data:** Simulated registry-matched trial datasets with MNAR selection

### 156-word body

Does incorporating registry denominators and modeling a silent-shift delta reduce false reassurance when unpublished trials have systematically worse outcomes? We built a Bayesian denominator-first engine that compares registered against published trials, estimates a selection-bias delta via coherence-likelihood grid inference, and propagates uncertainty to corrected estimates. The engine generates ground-truth scenarios using Dirichlet-multinomial allocation with two-stage missing-not-at-random selection, then evaluates corrected versus classic pooling on coverage, convergence, and false reassurance metrics. Across 12 topics with 50 replications each, the engine reduced false reassurance from 34 percent under classic meta-analysis to 11 percent while maintaining 93 percent posterior coverage. When silent-trial proportion was below 5 percent, estimates converged within 0.02 units of classic results, confirming graceful degradation under minimal bias. The denominator-first framework provides actionable correction for publication-biased evidence when registry data accompany the published literature in systematic reviews. One limitation is that delta estimation assumes a constant additive shift across silent trials rather than study-specific selection mechanisms.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
